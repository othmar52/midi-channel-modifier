# midi-channel-modifier
Arduino based MIDI channel modifier with LCD display and rotary encoders


## why?
I use a Doepfer LMK3+ MIDI keyboard which has great features but unfortunately changing MIDI channels is a pain in the a**. The original display and potentiometer are not comfortable to read/use.  

So i decided to create a DIN-MIDI-IN/DIN-MIDI-OUT Arduino with 2 rotary encoders and an easy to read display.  

Further the layer/split functionality of the `Edirol PCR-800` keyboard inspired to me to implement an easy to use layer/split functionality as well.
